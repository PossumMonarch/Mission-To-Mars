## Story 1:

Relativily simple task, I was pleased with how it went and how easy Tinkcard and the Arduino IDE were to use. Installing and learning how to use Git was by far the hardest part.





## Story 2:

The coding was very simple, the struggle was using Tinkcard to build an accurate example of what the 2 LED's would look like on an actual Arduino.

## Story 3:

Completed the task without issue after getting confused initially. Failed to use Git.

## Story 4:

I was confident on this task and did it easily. Once again failed to use Git.

## Story 5:

Using Git now seems to be impossible as it says that the tip of my current branch (main) is 'behind' despite me attempting to commit and push consistently. I have also been pulling before I push. From now on, all files will be uploaded remotely as it has the same end result. Additionally, I did not find use for the millis() code at all.

## Story 6:

Proud of my work on this one, felt I completed the task quickly and efficiently.

## Story 7: 

Again, felt I did well and didn't struggle with the task.

## Story 8:

I like how this story tied in most of what I have learned so far.
