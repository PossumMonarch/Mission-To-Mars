## Story 1:

Relativily simple task, I was pleased with how it went and how easy Tinkcard and the Arduino IDE were to use. Installing and learning how to use Git was by far the hardest part.





\## Story 2:

The coding was very simple, the struggle was using Tinkcard to build an accurate example of what the 2 LED's would look like on an actual Arduino.
